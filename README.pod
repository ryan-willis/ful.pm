One line to rule them all.

    use ful;

Brings the first C<lib/> directory found by directory ascencion and adds it to
C<@INC>.

Instead of:

    use lib::relative '../../lib';
    # or
    use FindBin;
    use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";
    # or even
    BEGIN {
        use Path::Tiny;
        my $base = path(__FILE__)->parent;
        $base = $base->parent until -d "$base/lib" or $base->is_rootdir;
        unshift @INC, "$base/lib";
    }

=head1 USAGE

When you're working within C<a-script.pl> when your project looks like this:

    project-root/
    ├── bin/
    │   └── utils/
    │       └── a-script.pl
    ├── lib/
    │   └── Some/
    │       └── Module.pm
    ├── vendor/
    │   └── SomeOrg/
    │       └── Some/
    │           └── Module.pm

Just drop the line before your other C<use> statements:

    use ful;
    use Some::Module;

And that's all.

If you need more than just the C<project-root/lib> dir, you can do this:

    use ful qw/vendor lib/;
    use Some::Module;
    use SomeOrg::Some::Module;

=head2 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item * C<libdirs =E<gt> \@dirs>

Equivalent to C<use ful qw/lib vendor/;> but can be combined with all other
options.

    # multiple @INC dirs
    use ful { libdirs => [qw/lib vendor/] };

    # combined with another option
    use ful {
        libdirs => [qw(lib vendor/lib)],
        dir     => 'vendor/lib',
    };

=item * C<file =E<gt> $file>, C<target_file =E<gt> $file>, C<target =E<gt> $file>

Finds an existing file to add a sibling directory to C<@INC>.

    # adds 'lib'
    use ful { file => '.file-in-project-root' };

=item * C<dir =E<gt> $dname>, C<has_dir =E<gt> $dname>, C<child_dir =E<gt> $dname>

Finds an existing directory to add a sibling directory to C<@INC>.

    # adds 'lib'
    use ful { dir => 'bin' };
